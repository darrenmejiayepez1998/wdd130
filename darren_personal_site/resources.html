            <h1 class="resource-title">The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey</h1>
            
                There is no better book that is not considered scripture for my church that 
                I would say has had more impact in my life than the 7 habits, I have read this 
                book twice and will go over it again, It is just filled with applicable advise and 
                it is based on principles that never change and is applicable to anything, this is a 
                world famous book and there is not much I can say that has not already been say but 
                I can give a strong recomendation that this is a book that will help you level up.
                In addition to that something I can add is how it has affected me, it has helped me 
                see that there is much I can do to improve in my day to  day by being more proactive, 
                seeking to understand others before I ask for understanding, as well as putting the 
                things that matter most first, I am not anywhere near to great in any of these things but I have 
                been able to improve on all of these things and more because of this book.

                This similar to 7 habits is a book that is based on eternal principles but 
                more from a negotiation persoective, this is especially helpful for people 
                that are getting into any of the fields that are in my portfolio or any field 
                really since negotiation is something essential in any art or buisness. There
                is a few similar principals in getting to yes with 7 habits, one of those is seeking
                the "other side" of a negotiation as another person and seeking to understand There
                view on the matter, there are a lot of examples in the book about the importance of 
                that principal.
