        <h1 class="resource-title">The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey</h1>
        <p1>
            There is no better book that is not considered scripture for my church that 
            I would say has had more impact in my life than the 7 habits, I have read this 
            book twice and will go over it again, It is just filled with applicable advise and 
            it is based on principles that never change and is applicable to anything, this is a 
            world famous book and there is not much I can say that has not already been say but 
            I can give a strong recomendation that this is a book that will help you level up.

        <p2>
            This similar to 7 habits is a book that is based on eternal principles but 
            more from a negotiation persoective, this is especially helpful for people 
            that are getting into any of the fields that are in my portfolio or any field 
            really since negotiation is something essential in any art or buisness.
