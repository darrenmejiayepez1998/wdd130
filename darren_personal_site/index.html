        <h1>Who I am</h1>    
        My name is Darren A. Mejia and I am an aspiring programmer and future game design student that is in school currently, 
        the goal of this website is to work as a space in which I can post updates and the finished product of things that I am 
        working on.
    
        
        
        A bit about me! I just got engaged to the beautifull woman with me in this picture, In addition to being a programmer 
        I currently work for Moxie Pest Control as a door to door sales rep for the summer in which doing that job has helped 
        me learn a lot since it is the hardest job I have ever had!
        I have a passion for videogames and movies especially those of the horror genre and I am devoted to my Faith.
        
        
        
        Basically everything I am currently posting on my Portfolio is still on the works but the goal of this site is also 
        to help me stay accountable to these projects since they will now be posted on the internet!
