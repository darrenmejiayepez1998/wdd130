                So one of my goals is to become a game designer and currently I am working 
                on understanding this free to use game engine called "Game maker" and even though because 
                of the busyness of life I am not dedicating as much time as I would like, I have been able to
                make about half a game through there helpful tutorials and plan on continue to work with that 
                engine in the time to come, so that when I get in school specifically for game design I have some 
                expierence under belt as small as it might be, I know this will help me a lot.
                There is another engine that I heard about called "Core" that is a free to use 3d endgine for people
                to start making games in, right now my main focus is on my summer door to door job but I will be 
                focusing on game design when I came back as well as my other classes. The game industry is one that 
                has interested me since I was around 5 years old and I have had the determination that this will be my career
                path since 10th grade and now is the time of my preperation to get there!

                Another thing I want to accomplish is to create a board or card game of some kind
                the main purpose of this game will not be to make money but to flex those creative muscles
                as well as to start thinking like a game designer more, my fiance and I have started
                rough drafts for a boardgame involving certain animals but it is still in the draft 
                part of the creation process and do not have much to show for it so far but that will 
                change with time. Another thing that I am doing is gathering a small team of friends 
                that could help me out with the creative process and after summer sales get in a brain storming 
                session together so that we can gather some ideas.

                The third project I have a small part off is an animation that is directed
                by one of my friends that I do summer sales with in which I play one of the 
                characters in this animation about a morning school anouncement, my friend 
                is a very talented animator so he will help me with future projects in which 
                I would write the screenplay I am very excited to also see the finished product
                of our first colaboration.
                It is fascinating to be see how ideas and a screenplay is written this will be another
                one of my focuses after the summer, my plate will be quite full since I will also be getting married 
                this October this just means I have to keep living a principal centered life and keep moving forward, 
                2023 will be one of the most eventfull years of my entire life!
