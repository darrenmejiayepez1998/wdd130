                So one of my goals is to become a game designer and currently I am working 
                on understanding this free to use game engine called "Game maker" and even though because 
                of the busyness of life I am not dedicating as much time as I would like, I have been able to
                make about half a game through there helpful tutorials and plan on continue to work with that 
                engine in the time to come, so that when I get in school specifically for game design I have some 
                expierence under belt as small as it might be, I know this will help me a lot.

            <p2>
                Another thing I want to accomplish is to create a board or card game of some kind
                the main purpose of this game will not be to make money but to flex those creative muscles
                as well as to start thinking like a game designer more, my fiance and I have started
                rough drafts for a boardgame involving certain animals but it is still in the draft 
                part of the creation process and do not have much to show for it so far but that will 
                change with time.

            <p3>
                The third project I have a small part off is an animation that is directed
                by one of my friends that I do summer sales with in which I play one of the 
                characters in this animation about a morning school anouncement, my friend 
                is a very talented animator so he will help me with future projects in which 
                I would write the screenplay I am very excited to also see the finished product
                of our first colaboration.
