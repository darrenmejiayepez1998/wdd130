      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of my personal website
      </p> 
      <p>
        So the main idea of this website is for me to have a platform for where I can submit the projects 
        that I am working on as well as documenting there purpose, not really in the style of a blog but in 
        the style of a journal so that it can also serve to help as a motivation tool. 
        The reason why other would visit this site would be so that they can see what I can do, 
        mainly possible future employers, it would be like a resume of sorts.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>The main page and one of the subpages</h3>
      <p>
        The main page would be about my “why”, what means that it will be a place where I can document the purpose around what I do, 
        it would talk about why I am currently in BYU Idaho and what my goals are, If I was to talk about it right now, 
        my main goals are to become a Videogame Programmer, that is the main reason I am taking coding and web design classes, 
        in the future I am going to attend a school that has a videogame design program that institution is called 
        “Digipen institute of technology” there are quite a few reasons that I am passionate about this goal in which I will expound 
        in my website the purpose would be to motivate others and myself, but also to help me to get into Digipen in the future since 
        I need to start journaling any creative projects since something that is required for my program is to submit a of portfolio 
        of 3 creative endeavors it does not have to be videogames it can be anything and I am currently working on a 
        couple and I am going to start on one of these which will be a animation, 
        one of the subpages will be the on the script for that animation it would be a good space to publish it 
        so that I can keep a journal of the different drafts I write.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resource sub page</h3>
      <p>
        I am reading a lot of content that is meant for self-improvement a lot of these books are fairly well known but there 
        are a lot of people my age or younger who do not know about these books or their value and this subpages purpose 
        would be to compile the ones I have gone through and document why they are a good read and what people 
        could get out of them, this sub page would include stuff like 7 habits of highly effective people and getting to Yes, 
        but in the future once I get to more books I would also add them to the page, 
        but for the sake of this project and the semester those would be the 2 main ones I would add there, 
        I do not want this to be confused with a blog post but more as a helpful more in-depth review or assessment of 
        why these books can be helpful for someone who is in similar circumstances as me, that be it that they are around 
        my age or that that they have similar aspirations as me, the reason I think this would be valuable is because 
        some of these books have true eternal principals that are helpful no matter what field you are in and more 
        people my age should be aware of them and should apply them to there life so that 
        they can reach there goals and aspirations, right now I am in my path to success and 
        this website will help me document the things I am doing and that I will be doing in the future to make it happen.
